Abstract
--------
Tool for CCS with value passing, value matching and sequence operator.

Moreover, this tool can compile PseuCo to CCS.

ToDo!


Usage
-----
Use htdocs/index.html with the latest version of Safari or Firefox. In this prerelease version you need a separate tool to convert PseuCo to a JavaScript representation. You can double click on the PseuCo field to pop up an additional text field, where you can paste the JavaScript representation.


**Note**: Unfinished prerelease software! Work is still in progress.
